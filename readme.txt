Improve Page Load Times with Our Powerful Image Compressor & Optimizer

== Description ==

= Generate Real-Time Responsive Images—Delivered at Maximum Speed =

Slow page load times hurt your website. Visitors don’t have the patience to wait more than three seconds for your site to load.

Piio significantly improves the load time of your website by generating real-time responsive images and delivers them using lazy loading. Your visitors experience images optimized for their device that are instantly available as they scroll through your website.

Piio delivers your images through an ultra-fast CDN, that is up to 10X faster than the Amazon S3 regular storage solution. Faster page load times create more user engagement and boost your SEO.

= What Makes Piio Different? =

Piio is more than an image compressor. It recognizes what device and browser your visitors are using and delivers pixel-perfect for EACH visitor in real-time. Using proprietary technology and state-of-the-art lazy loading, all of your images are delivered at lightning speed.

Lazy loading further enhances your page load speeds by only loading the content that your visitors need. You reduce the bandwidth your site requires and improve the user experience for every website visitor.

Piio anticipates when to load content below the viewpoint of your visitors. Users of your site will always see the images right as they scroll down.

It’s like Piio reads the minds of your website users.

= Why Choose Piio? =

Piio makes it easy for you to improve the performance of your site and your user experience. Piio is perfect for your website because:

- Setup is simple—plug and play
- No need to change storage providers
- No need to run batch processing scripts
- No maintenance after integration
- WebP format for Google Chrome support
- MozJPEG for better quality and small filesizes
- Piio delivers the most powerful image optimization technology available.

= More Than Just Image Compression =

There are more types of devices than ever before. If you are only using an image compressor, you will see some performance improvement, but your images will not be optimized for each visitor.

Mobile devices and browsers all different viewpoint sizes. Focusing only on image compression and resizing images is a losing game.

We want to make sure your site is loading fast and without compromising the user experience.

Our unique blend of image compression, responsive image optimization, and lazy loading makes sure that EVERY visitor has the same high-quality experience interacting with your website.

The Piio plugin makes your site smart enough to understand everything about your visitors.
